# Ideabox html



## Description

This is a project in which we wanted to create a interactive box that could give different ideas for activities you could do if you wanted a break.
To use the box you would need a toggleswitch, 4 microswitches, 2 servomotors, a RaspberryPi and the screen for it.
You can have different types of switches if you want some other form of interaction.
There is also a different interface where you can upload ideas to the database, which the box has access to.
You can find the other project under my repositories called IdeaBox Upload
